70. Climbing Stairs

You are climbing a stair case. It takes n steps to reach to the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

Note: Given n will be a positive integer.

public class Solution {
    public int climbStairs(int n) {
        if(n <= 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        if(n == 1) {
            return 1;
        }
        int first = 1;
        int second = 1;
        int result = 0;
        for(int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
            result = first + second;
            first = second;
            second = result;
        }
        return result;
    }
}
