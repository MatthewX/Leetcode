62. Unique Paths

A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).

The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).

How many possible unique paths are there?

public class Solution {
    public int uniquePaths(int m, int n) {
        if(m <= 0 || n <= 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        int[] dp = new int[n];
        for(int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            dp[0] = 1;
            for(int j = 1; j < n; j++) {
                if(i == 0) {
                    dp[j] = 1;
                } else {
                    dp[j] += dp[j - 1];
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[n - 1];
    }
}
